# Activity 8  
## Questions  
1) 
Similarities:  
* There is a board  
* Standard 52 card deck  
* Discard pile and draw pile  
Differences: 
* Deck size (13 cards, 10 cards, and 9 cards for Tens, Elevens, and Thirteens respectively)  
* Points to remove (10 points, 11 points, and 13 points to remove cards for Tens, Elevens, and Thirteens respectively)  
* Points values assigned to each card  
2) `Board` declares the variables and `ElevensBoard` initializes them in the constructor method  
3) `isLegal` and `anotherPlayIsPossible`  
I can't see the `ElevensBoard` file
